- Explored Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE)
    - A bright photo will have all its pixels confined to a relatively high value. Picture a histogram that is thin and tall. CLAHE will essentially normalize it, spreading the values so the histogram is shorter and wider.
    - Addresses: glare/bright spots in picture that make it more difficult to find corners.
    - Use: reducing glare in picture.
